# Networks-Data-Communications-Project-s
Each projects for networks and data communications for the Spring 2025 semester.

To run the server and client code in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project (or open an existing folder).

2. Inside that folder, create two files: server.py and client.py, then paste the corresponding code into each file.

3. Make sure you have Python installed and that the Python extension is enabled in VS Code.

4. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by selecting Terminal > New Terminal.

5. First, run the server:
   • In the terminal, type:  
  python3 server.py  
   (On Windows, you might need to type:  
  python server.py)

6. The server will start and wait for a client connection. Leave this terminal running.

7. Open a second terminal instance in VS Code:
   • You can click the plus icon (+) in the terminal panel to open another terminal.
   
8. In the new terminal, run the client:
   • Type:  python3 client.py  
   (Or on Windows:  
  python client.py)

9. Follow the on-screen prompts in the client terminal to send a TAM string to the server.

By following these steps, you'll have the server running in one terminal and the client in another, allowing them to communicate as designed.
